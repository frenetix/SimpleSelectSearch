### INTRODUCTION ###

Simple=Select+Search (SSS in shorthand) is an Google Chrome extension which allows it's users to perform intuitive, simple yet powerful way to search the World Wide Web. Most natural and fastest way - just highlight text and click on search engine in context menu. No typing, no waiting, no struggling.

### FEATURES ###

Current version of SSS (0.2.2):
- you can copy highligted text and call defined search engines for results
- you can set own search engines (in native Google Chrome way! You can go to Settings > Search > Manage search engines, copy design engine, paste it into SSS options and it'll work!)
- you can manage (to some level) how context menu with engines will look like
