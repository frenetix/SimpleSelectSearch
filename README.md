### INTRODUCTION ###

Simple=Select+Search (SSS in shorthand) is a Google Chrome extension which allows users an alternative to perform intuitive, simple yet powerful way to search the World Wide Web. Most natural and fastest way - just highlight text and click on search engine in context menu. No typing, no waiting, no struggling.

### FEATURES ###

:zero::two::two:
- you can copy highligted text and call defined search engines for results
- you can set own search engines (in native Google Chrome way! You can go to Settings > Search > Manage search engines, copy design engine, paste it into SSS options and it'll work!)
- you can manage (to some level) how context menu with engines will look like
