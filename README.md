#### HIGHLIGHT & CLICK, THAT'S IT! ####

### INTRODUCTION ###

Simple=Select+Search (SSS in shorthand) is a Google Chrome extension that allows users an alternative to performing an intuitive, simple yet powerful way to search the World Wide Web. The most natural and fastest way: highlight text on a page, and click on a search engine in the context menu. 
No typing, no waiting, no struggling.

### FEATURES ###

:zero::six::zero:
- you can copy highligted text and call defined search engines for results
