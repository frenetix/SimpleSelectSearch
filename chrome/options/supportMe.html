	Of course, this extension is for free -I built it to use it myself, actually-... but if you really enjoy using it, and you'd like to show your appreciation, here's a list of things that might make me happy :)
	<ul>
		<li><b>Show me the money:</b> Hit the <b>donate</b> button at the top right of this page... and send me a few bucks!</li>
		<li><b>Make Amazon pay me:</b> Use any of the Amazon links featured on the options page, search stuff using my extension and buy it! If I had the links set up properly and my affiliate account is working -haven''t tested it yet-, I might get a few bucks from Amazon... and it costs you zero!</li>
		<li><b>Guerrilla advertising:</b> <a href="http://twitter.com/home?status=OMG!
